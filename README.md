# Turn your Express app in the API

- **_Use this app as a starter code for your project._**

This is a backend boilerplate with Passport and example of Models.

.env is included by default, uncoment it in .gitignore in order not to push it to the repo.

- To test your app, go to Postman. Now your routes will start with: `http://localhost:5000/`
